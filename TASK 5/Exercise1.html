        <h1><i>Password hackers and crackers</i></h1>
        <hr color="#00FFFF">
        <p>The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If 
            the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group 
            milworm didn&#39;t convince you of their capabilities&#44; then consider this&#58; James Davis aka 
            jdavis&#95;a, a resident of <a href="#">www.geocities.com&#47;SiliconValley&#47;Bit&#47;2483</a> homestead community 
            on the Internet&#44; might just be reading your e&#8208;mail in your mailbox right now&#44; or using 
            your account for some being Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the 
            <br>
            Net for more such accounts&#33;
            <br>
            Surprised&#33; Or scared&#63;
        </p>
        <p style="color: red;">
            Formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            (a-b)<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2</sup>-2ab+b<sup>2</sup>
            <br>

            Whatever it is, jdevis&#95; claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got 
            exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily)&#44; <i>36 satyam&#44; 31 MNTL&#44; 11 WimiNet
